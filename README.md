 Project 1 - A Rule-Based Support Chatbot is an AI-driven tool designed to provide customer service and support by following predefined rules and logic. Unlike more complex AI systems that learn from vast amounts of data, this chatbot operates on a fixed set of conditions and responses, making it predictable and easy to control.
